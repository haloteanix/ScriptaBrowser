# ScriptaBrowser (ALPHA)
Very simple Android browser (Compatible with older versions like 4.2.2)

Scripta Browser is a simple browser for Android devices to do basically (almost) everything.
You can browse the web and... well, browser more with this application.

Sure, the design looks very bad BUT that doesn't mean it will stay the same. This project will remain being updated with bug fixes, design improvements and more.

Google Play Protect will try to prevent you from using Scripta Browser. Just click on "Install Anyway" if it prompts when installing.
